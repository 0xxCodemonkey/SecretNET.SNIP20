# Secret.NET SNIP20 / Secret Token
**Secret.NET SNIP20** is a layer on top of the [**SecretNET client**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET) (for the Secret Network Blockchain) which supports all methods of the reference implementation of the SNIP20 contract:
- Implementation => [GitHub - scrtlabs/snip20-reference-impl](https://github.com/scrtlabs/snip20-reference-impl)
- Implementation of a [SNIP-20](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-20.md), [SNIP-21](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-21.md), [SNIP-22](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-22.md), [SNIP-23](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-23.md) and [SNIP-24](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-24.md) compliant token contract.
- See also the [SNIP20 documentation on Secret Network](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/snips/snip-20-spec-private-fungible-tokens).

:white_check_mark: **This repository is explicitly intended to serve as a template for custom SNIP20 token contracts.** 
This makes it easy to create your own customized clients for your own customized contracts.
Of course, the concept can be used for any kind of smart contracts in general.
